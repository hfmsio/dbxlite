# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
- Latest release on `main`
- Previously tagged releases still in active use may receive fixes at maintainers' discretion

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please submit a private report via GitHub Security Advisories (Security → Report a vulnerability) so maintainers can triage and respond discreetly.
- Include: vulnerability description, reproduction steps, and potential impact

## What to Expect
- We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days.
- After triage, we will provide a remediation plan or mitigation timeline and follow up when a fix ships.
- When appropriate, we will coordinate a public disclosure once a patch is available.
